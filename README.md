# NYC Taxi Trip Data Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing New York City taxi trip data to gain insights into urban transportation dynamics. The analysis covers various aspects, such as trip velocity versus distance and time of day, and employs machine learning to predict taxi travel times.

## Features

- **Velocity Analysis**: Examine the relationship between taxi trip velocity and distance, as well as hourly velocity trends.
- **Data Cleaning**: Implement procedures to exclude outliers and prepare data for analysis.
- **Travel Time Prediction**: Develop a regression model to predict the duration of taxi trips.

## Datasets
The datasets used in this project, `taxi.csv` and `taxi_zone_lookup.csv`, are part of a public data release concerning NYC taxi trips. These datasets include detailed information on taxi pickup and dropoff times, trip distances, and other relevant metadata.

Due to the large size of the `taxi.csv` file, it is not stored directly in this repository. Instead, you can obtain the dataset from the [NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission's open data portal](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)
